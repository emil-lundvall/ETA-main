                <h1>FIRST, WHAT IS ESPORTS<b>?</b></h1>
                <p>Esports (or electronic sports) is a term used to describe competitive video gaming.<br></br><br></br>
The difference from standard video gaming is that esports is competitive (human-vs-
human) and usually has an engaging spectator element to it, like traditional sports, where skill
and professionalism is celebrated.<br></br><br></br>
Esports is also unique in that a player’s success is independent of gender, how tall,
strong, thin, or fast they are. Though there is certainly valuable insight linking good physical
health to enhanced gamer performance, it is ultimately inconsequential whether the gamer
stands at 5’2 or 6’8 tall.</p>

                            <p>No - in fact, over 380 million people watch esports worldwide both online and in
person. More people watched the 2016 world finals of popular esports game League of
Legends (43 million viewers) than the NBA Finals Game 7 that year (31 million viewers).<br></br><br></br>
Esports is a booming global industry where skilled video gamers play competitively.
In the same way that traditional sports have competitions in baseball, basketball, and football,
esports encompasses competitions across a variety of video games.<br></br><br></br>
Contrary to common perception, esports is not simply a phenomenon occurring in the
basements of unemployed twentysomethings; the industry is real, growing globally, and
offers opportunities to connect and engage with passionate audiences across the globe.</p>

game and play in a competition you can do so. If you&#39;re really great and you practice a lot
you might be on a big stage winning a million dollars. And that&#39;s open to everyone in the
large part. It&#39;s about making opportunities for anyone to do anything.&quot;<br></br><br></br>James Dean, CEO of ESL UK</p>
