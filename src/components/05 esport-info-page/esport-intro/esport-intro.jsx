                <h1>FIRST, WHAT IS ESPORTS<b>?</b></h1>
                <p>Esports (or electronic sports) is a term used to describe competitive video gaming.<br></br><br></br>
The difference from standard video gaming is that esports is competitive (human-vs-
human) and usually has an engaging spectator element to it, like traditional sports, where skill
and professionalism is celebrated.<br></br><br></br>
Esports is also unique in that a player’s success is independent of gender, how tall,
strong, thin, or fast they are. Though there is certainly valuable insight linking good physical
health to enhanced gamer performance, it is ultimately inconsequential whether the gamer
stands at 5’2 or 6’8 tall.</p>

                            <p>No - in fact, over 380 million people watch esports worldwide both online and in
person. More people watched the 2016 world finals of popular esports game League of
Legends (43 million viewers) than the NBA Finals Game 7 that year (31 million viewers).<br></br><br></br>
Esports is a booming global industry where skilled video gamers play competitively.
In the same way that traditional sports have competitions in baseball, basketball, and football,
esports encompasses competitions across a variety of video games.<br></br><br></br>
Contrary to common perception, esports is not simply a phenomenon occurring in the
basements of unemployed twentysomethings; the industry is real, growing globally, and
offers opportunities to connect and engage with passionate audiences across the globe.</p>

                            <p>Back in 2007, Intel started pushing esports with the first Intel Extreme Masters
gaming at CEBIT. Moving it towards organised, stadium-based tournaments.<br></br><br></br>
Since then the worldwide viewership of esports competitions has pushed popularity
into the mainstream. To the point that Intel even tried to get esports officially recognised by
the International Olympic Committee by bringing season 12 of the Intel Extreme Masters to
Pyeongchang during the 2018 Winter Olympics.<br></br><br></br>
Esports is a continually growing industry, both in popularity and money. In 2017,
esports had an estimated worldwide revenue of £565 million. In 2021, according to Statista
the global market for esports was valued at over 1 billion US dollars. Increasing by over 50%
from the year before.<br></br><br></br>

In 2021 esports had 474 million viewers and for 2022 the prediction is a growth by
11,5% according to Insider Intelligence’s estimate. This driven in large by video gaming-
specific streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming, that gives fans a direct
connection to the players and teams.<br></br><br></br>
According to an Ampere study, Sweden and Denmark are “leading the esports
viewing” in Europe with 8 – 9 % of of internet users watching on at least a monthly basis.
Leaving room for growth to reach the worlds top consumer of esports China, with 26% of its
internet users watching on a monthly basis.<br></br><br></br>
The European market is far less saturated and is home to many gamers who have yet
to tap into esports. In total, Europe represented about $138 million of global esports revenues.</p>

                            <p>Besides Intel, Red Bull was a pioneer. The energy drink is a brand that has managed
to keep itself in the top charts over the years and still remain relevant to consumers globally
to this date. Already in 2008 it recognized the potential of esports and hosted various events,
sponsored esports players, partnered with esports clubs, and produced esports videos. Their
efforts not only contributed to the growth of the industry but they also became an inherent
part of the market.<br></br><br></br>
Last year, Louis Vuitton stepped into the esports industry by collaborating with
League of Legends. They released a fashion line for both in-game assets and a physical
clothing collection.<br></br><br></br>
A lot of FMCG, e-tailers and big fastfood brands like, KFC, McDonald’s, Domino’s
Pizza, Pizza Hut, Panera Bread and Buffalo Wild Wings are already well positioned in the
space.<br></br><br></br>
Just in Q3 2021 the following new sponsors move into the space; Amazon (European
Masters) NASCAR (Allied Esports) Discord (Tribe Gaming) TUMI (Evil Geniuses) Doritos
(Bacon Time) Mastercard (League of Legends European Championship)</p>

                            <p>Esports is adventure, escape, fantasy and competition for digital natives. The most
engaged fans spend more than seven hours a week consuming esports content, often via new
nontraditional media. Twitch boasts an engagement rate from its active daily viewers of 106
minutes per person per day.<br></br><br></br>
However, esports is not the holy grail for brands just looking to reach new audiences
or investors looking for a quick return.<br></br><br></br>

Grounding an esports partnership is a thoughtful, step-by-step process and can
position almost any brand to take advantage of the considerable opportunities that this
emerging channels has to offer and creating long term value for the brand.<br></br><br></br>
A chance to connect to a hard-to-reach audience that spends twice the amount of time
gaming each week as they do watching TV is certainly a challenge.</p>
